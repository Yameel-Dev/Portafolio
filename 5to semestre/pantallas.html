            <h1>Containers</h1>
            <p>Containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain, pad, and align your content within a given device
            or viewport.

            How they work
            Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system.
            Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers can be nested,
            most layouts do not require a nested container.</p>

            <p>Usage with JavaScript frameworks
            While the Bootstrap CSS can be used with any framework, the Bootstrap JavaScript is not fully compatible with JavaScript
            frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular which assume full knowledge of the DOM. Both Bootstrap and the framework may
            attempt to mutate the same DOM element, resulting in bugs like dropdowns that are stuck in the “open” position.
            
            A better alternative for those using this type of frameworks is to use a framework-specific package instead of the
            Bootstrap JavaScript. Here are some of the most popular options:</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-12 col-md-6 bg-danger p-5 mt-5">
          <p>Using Bootstrap as a module
        Try it yourself! Download the source code and working demo for using Bootstrap as an ES module from the twbs/examples
        repository. You can also open the example in StackBlitz.
        
        We provide a version of Bootstrap built as ESM (bootstrap.esm.js and bootstrap.esm.min.js) which allows you to use
        Bootstrap as a module in the browser, if your targeted browsers support it.</p>

                <p>Data attributes
                Nearly all Bootstrap plugins can be enabled and configured through HTML alone with data attributes (our preferred way of
                using JavaScript functionality). Be sure to only use one set of data attributes on a single element (e.g., you cannot
                trigger a tooltip and modal from the same button.)</p>
